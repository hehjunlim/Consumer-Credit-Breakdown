# Consumer-Credit-Breakdown
This repository focuses on analyzing the link between e-commerce activity and credit card debt in the United States. The convenience of online shopping has led to higher spending and potential overconsumption. Through this project, we aim to quantify and visualize these trends, providing data-driven insights into the relationship between e-commerce adoption and rising credit card balances.
